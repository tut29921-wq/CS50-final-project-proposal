# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

**Power Snake** 



## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

M**y project will take inspiration from the game sanke but with a little twist. After every few 'fruits' eaten powers ups and map changes will happen.** 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

**My project will involve many different features and software. The software will allow players to control the snake that moves around eating food.  Some of the software will include features that will let your power up speed,animations,size, and more. The program will be done using Pygame and will be executed using the WASD keys. It will continually update as the game goes on.** 



## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

**I believe I will accomplish the main premise of the game no matter what. Which is to use the snake to eat food and grow longer.** 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

**I thnk that I will accomplish creating the background for the game and making the snake appear before the final project's deadline.** 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to accomplish most the game before the deadline. That includes using the snake to eat and grow longer while also having most of the animations.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps from here on out is to research youtube videos on similar games to see the necessary code to make this game work.These will help me be able to code the grid, the snake's starting position, and for the snake to appear o stream. New skills that I'll need to acquire include how to make an good animations,graphics,sprites, and how to store code.
